## Investigation Approach

### For Email Notification Issues:
1. Review email server configuration and credentials
2. Check network connectivity to email server
3. Examine frontend-backend integration for email notifications
4. Test email sending functionality in isolation
5. Implement proper error logging and handling

### For User Management Issues:
1. Review user creation workflow and code
2. Test user management interface functionality

2. Create separate forms for daily security and CCTV reports
3. Implement independent storage and retrieval for each report type
4. Update UI to clearly distinguish between report types
5. Ensure proper routing between different report sections

### For Inspection Form Issues:
1. Review original requirements for inspection elements
2. Compare current implementation with requirements
3. Add missing inspection elements
4. Ensure proper rendering of all form fields
5. Validate that all required elements are accessible

### For Submit Button Issues:
1. Review form submission code and event handlers
2. Check validation logic that might prevent submission
3. Test data storage functionality
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
5. Verify submission works across different browsers and devices
