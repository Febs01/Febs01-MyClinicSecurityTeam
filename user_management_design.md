# Admin Sub-User Management Design

## Overview
The admin sub-user management feature will allow administrators to create and manage additional users with different permission levels, providing controlled access to the security management system.

## Requirements
1. Allow admin users to create sub-users
2. Define different user roles and permission levels
3. Provide a user management interface for admins
4. Secure storage of user credentials
5. Support for editing and deleting users
6. Maintain audit trail of user actions

## User Roles and Permissions

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Super Admin**
   - Full system access
   - Can create/edit/delete all users including other admins
   - Can configure system settings
   - Default account (cannot be deleted)

2. **Admin**
   - Can create/edit/delete regular users
   - Full access to all reports and features
   - Cannot modify super admin accounts

3. **Supervisor**
   - Can view all reports and inspections
   - Can create reports and inspections
   - Cannot delete records
   - Limited access to system settings

4. **Regular User**
   - Can create reports and inspections
   - Can only view their own submissions
   - No access to system settings

### Permission Matrix

| Permission | Super Admin | Admin | Supervisor | Regular User |
|------------|------------|-------|------------|--------------|
| Create Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| View All Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| View Own Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete Reports | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Create Users | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Edit Users | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Delete Users | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| System Settings | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

## Technical Implementation

### User Data Structure
```javascript
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id-1",
      "username": "admin",
      "passwordHash": "hashed-password",
      "fullName": "Administrator",
      "role": "super_admin",
      "email": "admin@example.com",
      "createdBy": "system",
      "createdAt": "2025-05-22T10:00:00Z",
      "lastLogin": "2025-05-22T10:30:00Z",
      "active": true
    },
    // More users...
  ]
}
```

### Security Considerations
1. Password hashing using bcrypt
2. Secure storage of user data
3. Session management and timeout
4. Input validation and sanitization
5. Protection against brute force attacks

### User Interface Components
1. **User Management Dashboard**
   - List of all users with filtering and sorting
   - Quick actions (edit, delete, activate/deactivate)

2. **User Creation/Edit Form**
   - Username and password fields
   - Role selection
   - Personal information
   - Permission overrides (if applicable)

3. **User Profile Page**
   - Personal information
   - Password change
   - Activity history

## Implementation Plan
1. Create user data model and storage
2. Implement authentication system enhancements
3. Create user management interface
4. Implement role-based access control
5. Add audit logging for user actions
6. Test and validate all functionality

## User Experience Flow
1. Admin logs in with existing credentials
2. Navigates to "User Management" section
3. Views list of existing users
4. Can create new users with specified roles
5. Can edit or delete existing users
6. New users can log in with credentials provided by admin
7. Users see only the features and data they have permission to access
