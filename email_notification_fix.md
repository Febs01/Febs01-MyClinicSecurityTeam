# Email Notification System Fix

## Issue Analysis
The email notification system is not working because the email server is not running. This is a critical component that needs to be operational for notifications to be sent when reports or inspections are submitted.

## Solution Approach

### 1. Server-side Fixes
- Created a new Python-based email server script that doesn't require Docker
- Improved error handling and logging in the email server
- Made the recipient email configurable through environment variables

### 2. Client-side Fixes
- Enhanced the email notification JavaScript to better handle errors
- Added more detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Made the email server URL configurable instead of hardcoded to localhost
- Improved the retrieval of reports and inspections from local storage

### 3. Configuration and Documentation
- Created clear instructions for setting up email credentials
- Documented the email server setup process
- Added user-friendly error messages when email sending fails

## Implementation Details

### Email Server Script
Created a new `start_email_server_python.sh` script that:
- Sets up a Python virtual environment
- Installs required dependencies
- Configures email settings through environment variables
- Starts the Flask server in the background
- Provides clear instructions for configuration

### Frontend Integration
Updated `email-notification.js` to:
- Properly retrieve saved reports and inspections from localStorage
- Add better error handling and logging
- Make the email server URL configurable
- Provide more informative user notifications

## Testing and Validation
To validate this fix:
1. Start the email server with valid SMTP credentials
2. Submit a report or inspection
3. Verify that an email notification is sent to the configured recipient
4. Check server logs for any errors

## User Instructions
To enable email notifications:
1. Edit the SMTP credentials in the `start_email_server_python.sh` script
2. Run the script to start the email server
3. Keep the server running to receive notifications
