## Login Authentication Bug Fix

### Issue Description
- **Bug**: Login authentication failure with error message "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'authenticate')"
- **Reported**: May 22, 2025
- **Severity**: Critical (prevents system access)
- **Affected Component**: Authentication system

### Root Cause Analysis
The error occurred because the user management module (`user-management.js`) was not being loaded before the authentication module (`auth.js`) in the login page. This caused the `window.userManager` object to be undefined when the authentication code attempted to call the `authenticate` method.

### Fix Implementation
1. Modified `index.html` to include the script loading in the correct order:
   - Added `<script src="js/user-management.js"></script>` before `<script src="js/auth.js"></script>`
   - This ensures the user management module is fully loaded and initialized before any authentication code runs

### Validation Steps
1. Verified login works with default admin credentials (admin/admin123)
2. Tested login with invalid credentials to ensure proper error handling
3. Confirmed successful redirection to dashboard after login
4. Verified user session is maintained after login

### Lessons Learned
- Script loading order is critical for dependent JavaScript modules
- Authentication systems should have robust error handling for dependency failures
- Future updates should include comprehensive login flow testing
